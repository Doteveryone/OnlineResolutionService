    Radicalisation by extremist groups or individuals can happen in a number of ways: face-to-face, in organised groups in the community and, increasingly, online. Their targets are individuals or groups of people who can be easily led towards terrorist ideologies because of their experiences, state of mind or sometimes their upbringing.

    If you’ve seen or heard something that could suggest radicalisation, even if it seems minor or not worth mentioning, trust your instincts and report it to the UK Government [here](https://www.gov.uk/report-terrorism).

    It might be nothing, it might be something. But whatever you're worried about, it's important to report it.
