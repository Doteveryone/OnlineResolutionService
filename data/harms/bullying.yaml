    If someone targets you online by saying mean things, trolling, spreading rumours or excluding you, this counts as bullying (or 'cyberbullying'). Bullying is often repetitive, intended to hurt someone physically or mentally, and often aimed at certain groups (e.g. because of race, gender or sexual orientation). Online bullying might also occur alongside abuse in your school or workplace, by your peers, boss or colleagues. 

    Some forms of bullying are illegal and should be reported to [the police here](https://www.police.uk/) or by phoning 101. These include:
    * violence or assault
    * theft
    * repeated harassment or intimidation, for example name calling, threats and abusive phone calls, emails or text messages
    * hate crimes

    Bullying should not be tolerated online and the first step should be to report your experience directly to the platform through this service.
